# Simple Counter with React

> By Keili Rosales

## Objective

Using the ReactDOM.render() method in this exercise allows us to create a custom component to divide and conquer, since separating the logical and visual challenges in smaller parts gives us more control over the screen and the functionalities of each part of the web application.

It is for this reason, that the main purpose of the component is to show how many seconds have passed since the website finished loading (onLoad), for that it is necessary to create a component called SecondsCounter and apply the setInterval() function to re-render the component every second.

## Application

1. Install the NPM packages (be sure to use the latest version of node): `npm install`.
2. Run the project using: `npm run start`.
It verifies that the component is working and indicates the corresponding seconds after each OnLoad. 

## Technologies

- ReactJS
